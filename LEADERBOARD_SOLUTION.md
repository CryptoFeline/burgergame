# BurgerGame Telegram Bot - Leaderboard System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The original `/highscores` command was incorrectly trying to fetch scores from newly created game messages, which don't contain any scores yet. Telegram's `getGameHighScores()` only works with game messages that have already received score submissions.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Proper Leaderboard Flow
1. **`/highscores` command** creates a game message
2. **Users play the game** and submit scores via that specific message
3. **Telegram automatically** updates the game message with the leaderboard
4. **No manual score fetching** required - Telegram handles everything

### Key Implementation Details

#### 1. Enhanced `/highscores` Command
```javascript
// Creates a game message that Telegram will automatically populate with scores
await ctx.replyWithGame(GAME_SHORT_NAME, {
  reply_markup: {
    inline_keyboard: [
      [{ text: "🎮 Play & Set Your Score!", callback_game: {} }],
      [
        { text: "🔄 Refresh", callback_data: "refresh_leaderboard" },
        { text: "📤 Share", switch_inline_query: "Join me in Boss Burger Builder! 🍔" }
      ]
    ]
  }
});
```

#### 2. Automatic Score Updates
```javascript
// When scores are submitted, Telegram automatically updates the game message
const setScoreResult = await ctx.api.setGameScore(userId, score, {
  chat_id: chatId,
  message_id: messageId,
  force: true,
  disable_edit_message: false // KEY: Let Telegram update the message with leaderboard
});
```

#### 3. Enhanced Game Messages
- **First button always launches the game** (Telegram requirement)
- **Additional buttons** for leaderboard, rules, and sharing
- **Proper callback handling** for all button types
