# Burger Game - UI and Audio Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Unified UI Button Heights
- **Problem**: Score display, lives display, and stop button had inconsistent heights
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a unified `.ui-element` base class with consistent height (64px)
  - All UI elements now share the same height, padding, and styling
  - Responsive design maintains consistency across mobile breakpoints
  - Heights scale proportionally: 64px ‚Üí 56px ‚Üí 48px for different screen sizes

### 2. Audio System Implementation
- **Audio Manager Hook** (`useAudio.js`):
  - Centralized audio management with mute/unmute functionality
  - Preloads all audio files for smooth playback
  - Handles browser audio policy restrictions gracefully
  - Background music loops automatically
  - Sound effects play once per trigger

- **Audio Files Required**:
  - `background.mp3` - Background music (loops, 30% volume)
  - `ingredient-spawn.mp3` - New ingredient appears
  - `drop.mp3` - Player drops ingredient
  - `impact.mp3` - Ingredient lands successfully on stack
  - `life-loss.mp3` - Life lost (crossing boundary or hitting ground)
  - `game-over.mp3` - Game ends

### 3. Audio Integration Points
- **Ingredient Spawn**: When `generateBox()` creates new ingredient
- **Drop Sound**: When player clicks to drop ingredient
- **Impact Sound**: When ingredient successfully lands on stack (2s delay check)
- **Life Loss**: When ingredient crosses boundary or hits ground
- **Game Over**: When lives reach zero or player stops game
- **Background Music**: Starts with new game, stops on game over

### 4. Mute/Unmute Button
- **Position**: Left of the stop button in top-right corner
- **Visual States**: 
  - Unmuted: Speaker with sound waves (gray gradient)
  - Muted: Speaker with X (red gradient)
- **Functionality**: Toggles all game audio on/off
- **Responsive**: Scales appropriately on mobile devices

   - Ingredient spawn: Light "whoosh" or "pop" sound
   - Drop: Quick "release" or "click" sound
   - Impact: Satisfying "thunk" or "place" sound
   - Life loss: Warning "buzz" or "negative" tone
   - Game over: Completion chord or fanfare
