## 🚀 Deployment Status
✅ **Code pushed to GitHub** (commit: 62ff9f5)  
✅ **Auto-deployment to Netlify** should be in progress  
✅ **Bot function updated** with leaderboard features

## 🔍 Testing Steps

### 1. Bot Diagnostics
Visit: https://bossburgerbuild.netlify.app/bot-diagnostics.html
- Check bot status
- Verify webhook configuration
- Confirm environment variables

### 2. Basic Bot Commands
Test these commands in Telegram:

```
/start - Should launch the game with "Play BossBurger Builder!" button
/help - Should show comprehensive help with all commands
/stats - Should show game statistics for current chat
/highscores - Should show leaderboard access
```

### 3. Game Flow Testing

#### In Private Chat:
1. Send `/start` to the bot
2. Click "🍔 Play BossBurger Builder!" button
3. Play the game and achieve a score
4. Verify score submission confirmation appears
5. Check for "Share your achievement with friends!" message
6. Test the share button in game over screen
7. Send `/highscores` to view leaderboard

#### In Group Chat:
1. Add bot to a group
2. Send `/start` in the group
3. Multiple users play and submit scores
4. Verify "Check the group leaderboard with /highscores!" message
5. Test `/highscores` command to see group leaderboard
6. Verify different users can see each other's scores

### 4. Score Submission Verification

Watch for these confirmations:
- **Score 0**: "🍔 Nice try, [Name]! Practice makes perfect..."
- **Score 1-9**: "🎯 Good start, [Name]! You scored X points..."
- **Score 10-24**: "🏆 Impressive, [Name]! X points is a solid score..."
- **Score 25-49**: "🌟 Amazing work, [Name]! X points - you're becoming a burger stacking master!"
- **Score 50+**: "🔥 INCREDIBLE, [Name]! X points is absolutely phenomenal!"
