   /highscores  # View standard leaderboard
   ```

2. **Test Advanced Leaderboard**
   ```
   /advanced_scores  # View detailed analytics
   ```

   - Includes score statistics (min, max, average)
   - Shows user details and rankings
   - Provides refresh button for real-time updates

3. **Test Manual Score Submission**
   ```
   /submitscore 25  # Submit a test score
   /advanced_scores  # Check if it appears in detailed view
   ```

### Advanced Features Testing

1. **Refresh Functionality**

   - Check ranking order and statistics accuracy
   - Verify user information display

### Expected API Response Format

The `getGameHighScores` should return:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "position": 1,
      "user": {
        "id": 123456789,
        "first_name": "UserName",
        "username": "username"
      },
      "score": 150
    }
  ]
}
```

### Troubleshooting

- **"No scores found"**: Normal when no scores submitted yet
- **API errors**: Check bot permissions and message validity
