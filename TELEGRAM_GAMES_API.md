## How Telegram's Leaderboard System Works

1. **Game Message Creation**: When you send a game message, it gets a unique message_id
2. **Score Submission**: Scores are tied to specific game messages via chat_id + message_id
3. **Automatic Updates**: Telegram automatically updates game messages with high scores
4. **Persistence**: Scores persist and are tied to the specific game message forever
5. **Chat-Specific**: Each chat (private, group) has its own leaderboard for each game message

## Best Practices

1. **Always include callback_game as first button** - Required by Telegram
2. **Use disable_edit_message: false** - Let Telegram handle leaderboard updates
3. **Handle all callback types** - Game callbacks, custom callbacks, inline queries
4. **Provide clear user feedback** - Confirm score submissions with personalized messages
5. **Error handling** - Always answer callback queries to prevent timeouts

## Current Game Flow

1. User sends `/start` or `/highscores`
2. Bot sends game message with multiple buttons
3. User clicks "Play" button â†’ Game launches
4. User plays and achieves score
5. Game submits score via callback query with JSON data
6. Bot calls `setGameScore()` â†’ Telegram updates game message with leaderboard
7. User sees updated leaderboard in the game message automatically

This implementation follows Telegram's Games API best practices and provides a seamless leaderboard experience.
