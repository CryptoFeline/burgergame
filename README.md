# Stack Tower 3D

This project was made with Cannonjs, Threejs, 3-Fiber, 3-drei and React!

## About the Project

A 3D stack tower game built with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and React. It is a fun and interactive browser-based game that utilizes WebGL and the Three.js library to render 3D graphics within the browser. The game could involves building a tower by stacking blocks on top of each other, with the goal being to build the tallest tower possible without it collapsing.

React Three Fiber is a lightweight React renderer for Three.js, which allows using React components to build and control 3D scenes. This can be especially useful for building complex, interactive 3D games, as it allows for easy management of state and efficient rendering of 3D objects.

To build a stack tower game with these technologies, I started by setting up a basic 3D scene using Three.js and React Three Fiber. This would involve creating a renderer, camera, and scene, as well as adding lighting and any necessary materials or textures.

Next, I created the 3D objects that make up the tower, such as blocks, and add them to the scene. After this I implemented the gameplay mechanics, such as allowing the player to add new blocks to the tower and detecting when the tower collapses. This was possible by adding CannonJS Block Physics.

Finally, added all desired visual and audio effects, as well as any necessary user interface elements, such as a score display or button to start a new game.

Overall, building a 3D stack tower game with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and React is a fun and engaging project that showcases the power of modern web technologies for creating interactive 3D experiences.
